My original idea was to make a simple runner game. One where your character stays in place and obstacles move towards you. I had too much difficulty figuring out how to simulate gravity. As practice I started to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game. I knew that making each mouse button place a shape would be a bit of a challenge, and good practice. During this process it was suggested to me that I should make a matching game of sorts. My nine circles that were originally for a stylized version of Tic-Tac-Toe became the base for something similar to a Rubikâ€™s cube. Except to make things different this puzzle make moves every time you do.

Code for this project had many ups and downs. Starting off I had some trouble. My main goal was to make circles only change once they were clicked. Luckily, I found an example that did this and was able to use this as a guide. Once that initial hurdle was overcome it was just a lot of repetition. Nine times actually. I made it seem like the game was trying to stop the player from winning by adding extra code for when the player changes a circle color. This is never random as it might seem at first, because if it was the puzzle might be unsolvable. Another roadblock was making the circles react when the mouse was only hovering over them. I assumed there would be a mouseOver function, but I was wrong. The answer was a lot easier than I expected and it was just a variation on the way I set the circles to only react to a click if it was on them. The final difficulty was just arrays. I wanted randomly sized circles to flow across the background. I ended up with a grid of frantically moving circles that change color and size with every mouse click. It was not exactly what I had in mind, but it came out looking really nice.

This project was definitely a challenge from start to finish, but I really enjoyed that. The moments something made sense were wonderful, and after that I was always able to get a lot of work done. I learned a lot from this project, mostly that, although frustrating at times, I really enjoy the process of coding. 

Also the puzzle is very easy to solve, but could easily be made much more difficult. I did not do this because of the time that would take to troubleshoot that. I just wanted to showcase the idea of a puzzle that reacts to the player. I also wanted to make sure it was solvable, becaue I had to test the win screen.
